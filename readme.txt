A plugin for Ultimate member that allows users to display user suggestions in a simple widget.

== Description ==

Experience the ability to list user suggestions for your Ultimate Member community. If you are using the Ultimate Member plugins Followers or Friends then the plugin will only suggest users that you are not following or who you are not friends with. This way the plugin will always suggest someone new.

In an upcoming update the plugin will work with the [Ultimate Member Meet Me](https://suiteplugins.com/downloads/um-meet-me//?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=plugin&utm_content=meet-me) plugin to suggest users that match profile criteria that the current user is looking for.
